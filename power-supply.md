# Variable Power Supply — Dual Channel 48 V / 10 A

**Mission:** design a compact, high-current bench supply for electronics testing and motor control applications.  
**Architecture:** dual-channel output, XL4015 buck converters, analog current limiting, voltage display modules, fused input stage.  
**Execution:** modular bus design, aluminum enclosure, visual analysis, soldered ground plane layout.  
**Results:** 48 V / 10 A stable under load, used for charging LiPo batteries(for [FPV Drone](./fpv-drone.html).  
**Verification:** oscilloscope output trace, load-bank tests, calibration against Fluke DMM reference.
