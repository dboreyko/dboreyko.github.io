# Engineering Portfolio
Precision-built systems across aerospace, electrical, and mechanical domains. Focused on endurance platforms, power regulation, acoustic integration, and control actuation.

## Projects

- [**FPV Drone**](./fpv-drone.md) — Long-range reconnaissance quad designed for stable telemetry, high thrust efficiency, and vibration control.  
- [**Variable Power Supply**](./power-supply.md) — Dual-channel 48 V / 10 A regulated power supply with current foldback and modular bus outputs.  
- [**Subwoofer Installation**](./subwoofer.md) — 12″ sealed low-frequency system built for structural damping and clean signal reproduction.  
- [**ARA Airbrakes**](./airbrakes.md) — Servo-actuated airbrake assembly engineered for dynamic drag modulation and Mach correlation testing.
